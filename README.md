# QuixelAutoAssetClaimScript
This repository contains a JavaScript script designed to automatically claim all free assets available on the Quixel website in one click. The script interacts with Quixelâ€™s API to fetch the list of available assets, checks which assets you already own, and claims the unowned assets for you.
